  |   There was an urban legend. Write your troubles down on a note.        |
  |   Hold it in your hand at midnight and pray.  "God, please help         |
  |   me..."  Then God will hear your plea and change your fate.            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   A young girl wakes up, groggy and in an unknown room.  A talking      |
  |   dog appears before her and she becomes startled by his                |
  |   revelation: They are gods and it is their duty to change the fate     |
  |   of any humans that ask for their help.  Letters appear in the         |
  |   mail and with pen in hand she begins her job.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Dive deep into the story and learn about those that seek out your     |
  |   help but, remember, changing someone's fate will affect others.       |
  |   Experience each story, edit letters and solve puzzles; perhaps        |
  |   the young girl's memory will return, but what will she learn          |
  |   about herself and her mission?                                        |

  |   WILL: A Wonderful World features a fantastical tale and cast.  A      |
  |   quiet nerd stuck in a hopeless, one-sided crush.  An impoverished     |
  |   artist who's lost all hope and contemplates suicide.  A rookie        |
  |   police officer who burns with justice and hopes for his first big     |
  |   case.  A young woman desperately chasing her dream against all        |
  |   odds.  Even a stray cat who would be satisfied with some dried fish   |
  |   to eat!                                                               |

  |   You must guide their fates, find the links between the storylines     |
  |   and find the best path for all of those in need.                      |
